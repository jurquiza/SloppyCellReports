                <p>Our current understanding of biological clocks points to aun 
                    uderlying complex architecure composed of interlocked feedback loops. 
                    Mathematicl modelling has been fundamental for increasing our understanding 
                    of clocks in several model organisms. Flies, mammals, fungi, cyanobacteria and plants.

                <p>The aim of this community is speeding up the developoment of mathematical 
                    models that not only will reflect our understaing of how timing emerges 
                    in biology but how to harness this understanding for synthetic chrobobiolgy 
                    applications
